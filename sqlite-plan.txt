use libretrodb_tool to generate rdb.ndjson files

Read in ndjson as new struct type

slugify and map to unique slugs, prefering singe shortest rom name for scraping

after scraping read in XML and images, the XML game name can be re-slugified
map slug:gameID
create slug gamelistroms with game ID First

reload and loop ndjson adding gamelistroms based on slug:gameID map

each scraped game will have a unique slug in this case

TODO: SLUG should prioritize deduping over being perfect match, loosen up clauses
really just trim ()[] and reduce to lowercase

Game
    slug
        ROM (CRC)
        ROM
        ROM
        ROM
    slug
        ROM
    slug

        ROM


In this sense ALL roms that can map to a game must do so through a slug
This really simplifies the lookups
ROM names don't even need to be stored in the DB, and can instead be indexed by CRC
